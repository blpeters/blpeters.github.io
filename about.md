Hi - I'm Brett. I work with maps and visualize data. I have a bachelor's degree in civil engineering from The University of Texas, I'm wrapping up my Professional Geospatial Data Analytics & Visualization Certificate from Michigan State University, and I have over 10 years of experience in various professional settings including consulting, engineering, construction and real estate.

I've been a lot of things including engineer, project manager, cabinet-maker, photographer and drone pilot.  I have a wide breadth of knowledge, and I like using all of it. I see this as  a strength . I've solved a variety of problems and have found that so many skills transfer in surprising ways.
